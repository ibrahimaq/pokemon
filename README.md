# About
This is a Pokedex that searches Pokemons from the Pokemon API and presents the Pokemon details in a card-style format.

## Technologies used
- HTML & CSS
- Plain JavaScript

## Theme choice
I used minimal styling to a mimic a Pokemon card layout. Most important feature is that the card colour changes depending on the 'type' of Pokemon fetched.

## Learning curve
This is the first project where I had to fetch data from an external API. I learnt how to fetch from an API and only extract the required data from it to be stored in objects.
Another learning point was when I had to change the card colour depending on the pokemon 'type' e.g. the colour green for grass Pokemons.

## Things to improve
- add a 'comparison' feature where users can compare any given two Pokemons.
- improve styling
